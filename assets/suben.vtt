subrica.com

00:00:01.222 --> 00:00:03.222
Ugh, you're a monster

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:06.946
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:08.965
Better hit the deck like the card dealer

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.472
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party

00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:13.758
A cross between a zombie apocalypse

00:00:13.768 --> 00:00:16.168
and B-Bobby "The Brain" Heenan which is probably the

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.767
Same reason I wrestle with mania

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:19.364
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.234
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake

00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:25.327
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia ADHD, Hydroxycut

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:27.276
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.161
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate

00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:32.237
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.119
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A

00:00:35.128 --> 00:00:36.728
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:38.305
They cannot tame or placate the Monster

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:41.204
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)

00:00:41.235 --> 00:00:44.035
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:47.205
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers

00:00:47.258 --> 00:00:50.058
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters

00:00:50.126 --> 00:00:52.093
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster

00:00:52.098 --> 00:00:55.098
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet

00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:57.948
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.103
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet

00:01:00.104 --> 00:01:02.704
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:04.938
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:06.492
It's impossible to list 'em all

00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:07.573
And in the midst of all this

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:09.569
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball

00:01:09.595 --> 00:01:10.795
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:11.900
Risperdal, voices whisper

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:14.362
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:16.011
This is just the song to go ballistic on

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:18.124
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.110
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.350
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:24.755
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a Monster

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:27.515
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.179
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)

00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:33.428
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers

00:01:33.452 --> 00:01:36.285
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:38.276
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:41.246
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet

00:01:41.324 --> 00:01:44.224
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.030
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:49.196
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand

00:01:49.248 --> 00:01:52.015
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans

00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:54.823
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.615
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.490
How can I have all these fans and perspire?

00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:01.035
Like a liar's pants on fire

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.869
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire54

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:06.867
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.720
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:12.317
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw

00:02:12.377 --> 00:02:13.210
'Cause I caught the flack

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:15.291
but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball

00:02:15.353 --> 00:02:16.353
Like Kid Ink, bitch

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:18.696
I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:21.472
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)

00:02:21.498 --> 00:02:24.298
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:26.397
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:28.240
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her

00:02:28.241 --> 00:02:30.341
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.179
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well

00:02:32.253 --> 00:02:33.253
So they wanna give me the chair

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:35.593
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari

00:02:35.684 --> 00:02:38.684
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em

00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:40.218
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious

00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:42.082
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:44.012
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem

00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.258
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)

00:02:45.313 --> 00:02:47.247
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.200
Evil half of the Bad Meets

00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:49.483
Evil, that means take a back seat

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:51.023
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single

00:02:51.082 --> 00:02:52.549
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people

00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:54.274
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:56.534
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:11.495
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:12.374
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em

00:03:12.444 --> 00:03:14.044
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:15.081
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade

00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:16.243
I'm fittin' to kill 'em and dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake

00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:17.526
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade

00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:19.223
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.579
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway

00:03:20.622 --> 00:03:21.767
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.643
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla

00:03:23.643 --> 00:03:24.697
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me

00:03:24.697 --> 00:03:26.239
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.902
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be

00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:29.074
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:30.569
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.807
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.197
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me

00:03:33.244 --> 00:03:34.544
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable

00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:36.328
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blown up like an inflatable

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.590
I'm unbeatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm inevitable

00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:39.746
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

00:03:39.777 --> 00:03:40.910
I'm not afraid to pull a—

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.927
Man, stop

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:43.856
Look what I'm plannin', haha
